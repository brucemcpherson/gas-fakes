# <img src="../logo.png" alt="gas-fakes logo" width="50" align="top"> Allowing Access to Workspace Scopes with Local Google Authentication

This guide summarizes how to overcome the "Google has blocked access" error when using local Google authentication (`authType: adc`) with regular Workspace scopes (e.g., `.../auth/drive`, `.../auth/spreadsheets`, `.../auth/gmail.compose`) during local development.

## Core Problem
When you run `gas-fakes auth` (which calls `gcloud auth application-default login`) without a `--client-id-file`, your local identity is minted using Google's generic, globally shared "Google Cloud CLI" OAuth Client ID. 

Recently, Google restricted this generic Client ID from requesting regular Workspace scopes to prevent phishing and unauthorized access via generic CLI tools.

> **Note on Domain-Wide Delegation (DWD):** This change **does not affect** users using `authType: dwd`. In DWD mode, `gas-fakes` uses your local identity only to sign tokens for the service account, which only requires basic scopes like `cloud-platform`. These basic scopes are not blocked for the generic gcloud client ID. The actual Workspace scopes are then minted via the service account, which bypasses the generic client's restrictions. Therefore, **DWD works without a custom client credential file.**

## Solution: Using a Custom OAuth Client ID (for `authType: adc`)

The solution for users of `authType: adc` is to create a custom OAuth Client ID within your own Google Cloud Project and instruct `gcloud` to use it for your local authorization. This bypasses the default restrictions while maintaining a secure, keyless chain of trust.

### Step 1: Configure the OAuth Consent Screen

1.  **Navigate to OAuth Consent Screen:** In the Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services** → **OAuth consent screen**.
2.  **Set User Type to Internal:** Choose **Internal**. This is crucial for local development as it avoids the external app verification process. Click **Create**.
3.  **App Details & Scopes:**
    *   Provide an app name (e.g., "gas-fakes local dev") and support email.
    *   On the **Scopes** page, click **Add or Remove Scopes**.
    *   Manually add all necessary scopes (e.g., `.../auth/drive`, `.../auth/spreadsheets`, `.../auth/gmail.compose`).
    *   Click **Add to Table**, then **Update**, and finally **Save and Continue**.

### Step 2: Create a Custom Desktop Client ID

1.  **Navigate to Credentials:** Go to **APIs & Services** → **Credentials**.
2.  **Create OAuth Client ID:** Click **+ Create Credentials** and select **OAuth client ID**.
3.  **Configure for Local Use:**
    *   Set the **Application type** to **Desktop app**.
    *   Give it a name (e.g., "gas-fakes desktop client").
    *   Click **Create**.
4.  **Download Credentials:** Download the JSON file and save it locally (e.g., `private/adc-credentials.json`). 
    *   **CRITICAL:** Add this file to your `.gitignore`. Never commit it to a public repository.

### Step 3: Initialize gas-fakes with the Custom Client ID

If you are using the CLI (`gas-fakes init`), you will be asked:
> "Do you want to use a custom OAuth2 client credentials file to support Workspace scopes?"

Provide the path to the JSON file you downloaded in Step 2.

### Completion
A browser window will open. As an internal user of your own project, you can now grant access to the application, including the Workspace scopes. Your local configuration will be updated with a refresh token linked to your custom, authorized Client ID, allowing both ADC and DWD modes to operate without restriction.
