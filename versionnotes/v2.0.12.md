## changes

- to support readonly filesystems, we now skip writing the settings file if it fails - this is normal in ephemeral environments such as AWS lambda, where writing the settings file is neither possible nor necessary anyway. 
- since aws client doesnt support get token info from its client, we fall back to using the subject in the environment variable of we cant get it any other eway,
